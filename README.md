## 4.2 - Etsy Recreation

Etsy recreation was our very first project working with APIs and making specific AJAX calls with jQuery. This was definitely one of my favorites up to this point in my time at the Iron Yard because it was practical yet complicated, in both the behind the scenes data handling and the way in which it's displayed. This was the project that helped solidify my skills in responsive web layout and using templates.
